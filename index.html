This clothes exchange isn't about money, it’s about smiles. When you put clothes in the container the screen will light up and you can choose which clothes donation center it goes to. If you enter your phone number you can get a picture of the person wearing what you gave

My idea for the Copper Henwit Challenge is to improve Salvation Army donation boxes. I would add a screen to each box so people can choose which shelter their clothes go to. After donating, they can enter their phone number. Later, they get a text with a short video of a kid wearing their clothes. This makes donating more personal and shows people their help really matters.
